# Pokemon Gen 2 Online Tracker
Online Tracker for Pokemon Gen 2 

This is hardcoded for Gen 2 Pokemon
It uses Web rtc to connect to the other person and I'm not hosting any server to find people so you have to do the handshake semi-manually.
I tried to make it easy though, basically just send the text it gives you to the other person over some sort of IM and follow the directions
